                <br>
                <p>I started off the night with some hard Tequilla shots. Then I drank a 36oz glass of Rum and Coke before the Tequilla shots kicked in, and when they kicked in they kicked my fucking ass. As soon as we got dressed we took off to the party and then I had about four more beers.</p>
                <br>
                <P>Maybe it wasn't such a good idea, I was absolutely fucked up beyond belief and I could barely stay stood up for more than a few seconds at a time, to be honest, it was really embarassing, and I would've opted to go home under any other situation.</P>
                <br>
                <P>But what else was I supposed to do? I was there, bearing witness to the beauty of WESN god Uehara, and if I didn't follow my role to the dot I'd've been shot dead where I stood. It wasn't all bad though, Sydney was there, and God bless her she always knew what to do when the rest of us were out of our shit.</P>
                <br>
                <P>Uehara and I got pretty faded, too, we ended up talking about the has-been's of the world and how different things were only a few decades ago; To be honest, it was quite humbling and definitely calmed my nerves.</P>
                <br>
                <P>By the time it was 4AM, everyone was pretty out of it, Sydney and I had decided it was time to ditch these bozo's and get outta dodge, in her state she was useless, I ended up carrying her to my place and she puked on me a few times, I'm not into that kinda stuff but she's always cute, so I didn't mind.</P>
                <br>
                <P>We'd made it to my place, and she'd passed out by now, my head was already killing me and I was pissed off with myself, "FUCK Uehara", I Thought to myself "WESN ain't shit.", I'd put Sydney down on my couch by now and had practically collapsed onto my floor, I woke up only 2 hours later with an awful headache.</P>
                <br>
                <p>Sydney was awake too, and we ended up playing a few video games together until 6 AM where we both collapsed into eachother; with a roommate of mine checking every 15 to see if we hadn't choked on our own shit or vomit.</p>
                <br>
                <P>At about 2PM the same day, I woke up to Sydney holding her shirt in front of my face and complaining that my washing machine was broken, I ended up giving her spare clothes of mine and we've been speaking since.</P>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>That Uehara is something else, I have no clue what's up with that freak, if you're reading this, I want my shuriken style back!</p>
