				<P>For Deus Ex's "Game Of The Year" patch release, it came internationally bundled with a <i>multiplayer</i> gamemode addition, a PvP deathmatch focused experience in which players would fight in team or free-for-all matches.</P>
				<P>For Japan's February 2001 release of the game, the multiplayer came pre-packaged and ready to go, but was seperated from the original, international release of the game to prevent file mismatching.</P>
				<p>(For example, a player who had bought a copy of the game in the USA (international release) could not play on any Japanese servers, and a player who had bought a copy of the game in Japan (Japanese 2001 release) of the game could not play on a server hosted on the international release of the game)</p>
				<p>The Japanese version of Deus Ex, and its Multiplayer <i>(Abbr: DXMP)</i> came heavily modified, and considerably easier, hitscan and melee low-tech weapons do 4x damage, the drain of your bioelectricity is halved, and the energy cost of multiple augments had been changed.</p>
				<p>These changes, all made by one person; "Nishimura", apparently weren't taken all too well, and the Japanese DXMP scene stuck to more "objective based" game-modes. (Capture the flag, Assault, etc.)</p>
				<br>
				<p class="miniport">NAOMI</p>
				<P>NAOMI is a faithful attempt to recreate this "Japanese Deus Ex Multiplayer Experience" for the international Deus Ex GOTY release; with an actual copy of the Japanese Deus Ex release as a reference, NAOMI is currently the only attempt to port the Japanese values to GOTY DXMP (That I'm aware of), and it's about as stupid as 4x damage sounds.</P>
				<P>NAOMI is currently <strong>still in development</strong> and despite being fully playable, may contain a few bugs; be sure to report these bugs, and I'll get on them as soon as I can.</P>
				<P>NAOMI is an easy download and set-up, check "<i>installation</i>" for more info on how to download and install NAOMI to your deus ex server.</P>
				<p></p>
